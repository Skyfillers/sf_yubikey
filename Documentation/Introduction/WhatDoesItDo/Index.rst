What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension is an authentication service for TYPO3 which extends
the frontend and backend login process by strong two-factor
authentication.

The two-factor authentication is provided by a TYPO3 users username
and password combined with a OTP (one time password) which is
generated by a YubiKey (a physical USB-key)

A YubiKey enabled user has to enter his username, password and a OTP
to login to the TYPO3 backend and/or frontend.

More information about the YubiKey, Yubico and the YubiCloud OTP
validation service can be found at `http://www.yubicom.com
